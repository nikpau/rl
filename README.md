# Reinforcement learning algorithm dump

Here you find all of my WIP regarding implementations of reinfocement learning algorithms. No guarantee for functionality whatsoever.

All `.dat` files are PyTorch net weights that can be loaded into a fiting (!) net via `load_state_dict(*.dat)`. The file should usually fit. If not please read https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html 

Don't be confused with the file extensions. I just named them .dat for distiction.
